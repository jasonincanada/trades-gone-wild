# trades-gone-wild
This is a side project using C# to manage pending trade plans.  Tick data is borrowed from the local MT4 installation running the [TickPunker expert advisor](https://github.com/nirgle/trades-gone-wild/blob/master/TradesGoneWild.Domain/TickPunker/TickPunker.cs).

Current ideas:

* Various visualizations of trade plans
* [OANDA API](http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live/development-guide/) for trade execution
